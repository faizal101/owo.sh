# OwO.sh


A basic example/uploader for uploading to [owo-whats-th.is](https://owo.whats-th.is)'s image server. The aim was to have a script that allowed for users of all operating systems (that werent already supported by ShareX) to also be able to upload to whats-th.is related products.

Thank you to [jomo](https://github.com/jomo/) and his script [jomo/imgur-screenshot](https://github.com/jomo/imgur-screenshot), to which taking snippets and borrowing code has guided me to improving my own script. This script wouldn't be anywhere near what it is today without his efforts.

## Dependencies

| os         	 | dependency                   | description
|--------------- |----------------------------- |-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| MacOS     	 | Terminal Notifier            | Default OSX Notifications suck and barely work, this is a workaround for that.
|      	     	 | Screencapture                | Comes default with OSX and is the client that you use when you press CMD + Shift 3 or CMD + Shift 4.
|      	      	 | Pbcopy                       | Comes default with OSX and is used to copy things to your clipboard.
|      	     	 | GREP                         | Comes standard with all UNIX OSes and is used to (in this case) decipher JSON.
|      	     	 | cURL                         | Comes standard with all UNIX OSes and is used to (in this case) upload to the owo server.
| Linux     	 | Notify-Send                  | Default Linux barely has any, if at all, notification support from terminal. This is a workaround.
|       	 | Maim                         | A rich screenshotting client, that better than what comes default with Linux.
|     	     	 | XClip                        | Comes default with most UNIX based OSes and allows for things to copied to clipboards.
|      	     	 | GREP                         | Comes standard with all UNIX OSes and is used to (in this case) decipher JSON.
|     	      	 | cURL                         | Comes standard with all UNIX OSes and is used to (in this case) upload to the owo server.

## Installation

1. Once you install the dependencies above, simply run the command


```shell
curl -L  https://owo.codes/whats-this/owo.sh/raw/master/supersetup.sh | bash
```
in your terminal.
## Usage

Basic usage of the script is like so.

```shell
owo image.png
```

However the following flags can be placed after `owo` for the each of the results.

| short | command          	| description                                                                                        |
| ----- |------------------	|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |
| -h    | --help           	| Shows this help screen to you, displaying all the avaliable commands.             	             |
| -v    | --version        	| Show current application version, incase you wanted to reference it elsewhere.        	     |
| -c    | --check          	| Checks whether or not dependencies are installed. Response with a `INFO  : ` or and `ERROR : `.    |
|       | --update         	| Checks whether or not your application is completely up to date. If not it will alert you.         |
| -l    | --shorten        	| Begins the url shortening process. This can be done through application or another argument.       |
| -s    | --screenshot     	| Begins the screenshot uploading process. Your OS should be able to guide you through this however. |
| -gr   |                       | Begins screencast (gif) recording process. At this time, this feature is only available on Linux   |
| -gs   |                       | Stops the screencast (gif) recording process and starts encoding/uploading.                        |

#### Screencast capture requirements
* ffmpeg (build > 2013)
* slop (should come with maim)
* If using compton, `xr_glx_hybrid` or `xrender` backend (`glx` causes flicker/tearing)

## Using the Mac Workflow

1. Unzip the workflow file `owo-uploader.workflow.zip`
2. Click on the workflow file. When prompted to install, click yes.
3. Go to `System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Services`
4. Scroll down to `General` and look for `owo-uploader`. Assign a shortcut to it.
5. (Optional) Disable default screenshot keys in `System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Screen Shots`

Now when you press your selected shortcut, the screenshot uploader will be launched, without having to type anything in the shell.
